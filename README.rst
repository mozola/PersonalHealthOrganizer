What is the PersonalHealthOrganizer?

PersonalHealthOrganizer is the project created to manage user diets and trainings. Also this app can be used to manage user fridge. 

What does it mean?

It's mean that when the user planing meals to the next week than he can prepare something like sprint with contain all meals on this week.

Next step will be do the shopping and when you start your sprint you will see all your products in your basket. When you eat some meals and update sprint then he will see less products in the basket. When user finished sprint then will see what products you have and what you need to prepare
meals to the new sprint.

It's all?
No. In this project we will see something Exercise Planner but this is not implemented yet. Instruction how to prepare sprints and how to manage sprints I will add soon.

Bellow are presented screens from the program.
