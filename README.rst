DIX is the project created to manage your diets and trainings. Also this app can be used to manage your fridge

What does it mean?

It's mean that when you planing your all meals to next week you can prepare something like sprint with contain all your meals on this week.
Next step will be do the shopping and when you start your sprint you will see all your products in your basket. When you eat some meals and update 
your sprint you will see less products in your basket. When you finished sprint you will see what products you have and what you need to prepare
meals to the new sprint.

It's all?
No. In this project we will see something Exercise Planner but this is not implemented yet. Instruction how to prepare sprints and how to manage sprints I will add soon.


Best Regards,
DIX
